# Matched filtering with a glitch bank

In this repository you will find a code to perform matched filtering method with blip glitches generate artificially with a Generative Adversarial Network. The output of this code is the signal-to-noise ratio calculation. This work forms part of the workshop "Best Practices for Writing Reproducible Code".

## Prerequisites

To perform the analysis is necessary to install standard packages of gravitational waves analysis: [PyCBC](https://pycbc.org) and [GWpy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/). This code uses Python 3.6 or higher.


## Installation

To install this you can:

`git clone git@github.com:MelissaLP/best-practice-example.git`
